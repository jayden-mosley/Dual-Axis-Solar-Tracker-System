##Hardware Required:
Arduino UNO

2x Servo motors (e.g., SG90 or MG995)

4x LDRs

4x 10k ohm resistors

Breadboard and jumper wires

##Circuit Design Summary:
LDRs are placed in four quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right)

Each LDR forms a voltage divider with a resistor and connects to Arduino analog pins.

Servo1 controls horizontal rotation (left/right)

Servo2 controls vertical rotation (up/down)

Notes:
Calibrate the threshold for your environment.
